### 📥 How to Download and Set Up the Script on Windows 2025  
Getting started is super easy! Follow these steps to download and run the script on your Windows machine. We've included emojis to make it visually awesome. 😄  

1. **Prepare Your Windows Environment** 🔧  
   First, ensure your Windows system is up-to-date for 2025. Head to Settings > Update & Security and install any pending updates. This keeps your PC secure and compatible with modern Roblox features. 🛡️ Pro tip: Enable Developer Mode in Windows Settings for easier script execution – it's a game-changer!  

2. **Download the Script** 💻  
   Click the download button above to grab the script file. Once downloaded, you'll have a .lua file ready to go. Make sure your antivirus is okay with it – Windows Defender in 2025 has smart scripting detection, so add an exception if needed. ⚠️  

3. **Install Required Tools** 🛠️  
   You'll need a script executor to run this on Roblox. For Windows 2025, we recommend using a trusted executor like Synapse X or similar (ensure it's updated for 2025 compatibility). Download it from its official site, then extract the files using Windows File Explorer. Double-click to install – it's straightforward! 📂  

4. **Load the Script into Roblox** 🎯  
   Open Roblox on your Windows PC and launch Blox Fruits. In your executor, navigate to the script file you downloaded. Hit the execute button, and watch the magic happen! 🌟 If you're on Windows 11, use the new quick launch features to pin Roblox for faster access.  

5. **Troubleshooting Common Issues** 🔍  
   - **Error Loading Script?** 😵 Check if your Roblox client is updated to the 2025 version. Go to the Roblox website, download the latest installer, and restart your PC.  
   - **Performance Lags?** ⚡ Adjust your Windows graphics settings in Settings > System > Display for optimal Roblox performance. Enable hardware acceleration if available.  
   - **Script Not Working?** 🤔 Ensure your executor is whitelisted in Windows Security settings. Sometimes, 2025's enhanced security features block scripts – just add an exception and try again.  

This process is tailored for Windows users in 2025, leveraging the OS's new AI-driven features for seamless gaming. Expect faster load times and better integration with Roblox's updates! 🚀
